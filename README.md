## Description

### Scenario

Kasa is a fictional web app for renting an apartment.

### Coding guidelines

- The project must be bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
- The project should not use any external libraries.
- There should be no error or warning in the console.

### Highlights

- In order to ensure the code quality, I have used [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to lint and format the code.
- Because using external libraries were not allowed, the carousel was completely made from scratch. To make It performant and elegant (I wanted to add a sliding animation), I decided to display only 3 images at a time, and dynamically add the rest of them when the user clicks on the "next" or "previous" button. Here is a diagram showing how it works :

![CarouselStructure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85347446/173227523-8be13385-547d-4b68-84e3-ac9163b29cda.png)

Note : If the carousel is provided with only one image, the controls are not displayed. If the carousel is provided with two images, It will be still working (the last image of the list will be duplicated in order to show the animation).
